/**
 * Contains classes for the extraction and modelling of MP4 file format metadata.
 *
 * This MP4 reader package is handler based.  Each MP4 file is composed in a hierarchical structure that contains boxes.
 * Boxes all have the same initial structure, but the rest will change depending upon the box type.  A box can either be a
 * standalone (leaf) box or a container.
 *
 * Mp4Reader will recursively go through all of the boxes using the handlers to know which container/box should be read.
 * A new handler is created when the current container has an immediate ‘handler’ box.  This means that the way the
 * containing boxes are read may depend upon that information.  This is also very important because some boxes have
 * the same name and the only way to determine how to read this data is with the handler.
